                <h6>Key Points:</h6><br> 

                <span style="line-height: 20px;">
                    The primary purpose of introducing the QFS ledger was to provide a secure system for protecting our money under our own custody. This ensures that neither governments nor powerful entities can track, control, or monitor our transactions, impose mandatory terms, or confiscate assets held in banks. It also safeguards against cyberattacks and manipulation within the traditional banking system.

                <span style="line-height: 20px;">
                    Economic crashes are not permanent; they are expected to last approximately 7–9 years, similar to events seen in the 1950s. Such crises often resemble a form of warfare, where governments and influential groups use financial systems to suppress the masses.

                <span style="line-height: 20px;">
                    During events like widespread power outages or internet shutdowns, people may lose track of their assets — whether gold, silver, or fiat currency in banks. However, a mobile phone remains one of the simplest and most reliable tools for securing access to your assets, even during major disruptions.

                <span style="line-height: 20px;">
                    By holding your assets in the QFS system, you can securely log in to your QFS account from any available mobile device using an offline internet browser (such as HTTrack, WebCopy by Cyotek, SiteSucker, Kiwix, or Internet-in-a-Box), even when normal systems are down.

                <span style="line-height: 20px;">
                    This allows you to retain access to your XRP and XLM holdings and resume transactions through your credit card, which is the recommended means of payment after a financial crash.

                <span style="line-height: 20px;">
                    Take control of your financial future. Secure your wealth with QFS today—because true freedom means having power over your own money, no matter what happens around you.
