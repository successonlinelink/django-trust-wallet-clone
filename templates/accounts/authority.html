                    Under the go-ahead order, the company is permitted to conduct cryptocurrency-related operations — such as trading, blockchain development, digital asset management, or payment services — in compliance with the country’s financial and data protection laws. The move signifies a recognition of the company’s legal standing and operational readiness, while ensuring regulatory oversight to prevent illicit activities and maintain consumer protection.
